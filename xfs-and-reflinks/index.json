  "description": "Copy-on-Write filesystems have the nice property that it is possible to 'clone' files instantly, by having the new file refer to the old blocks, and copying (possibly) changed blocks. This both saves time and space, and can be very beneficial in a lot of situations (for example when working with big files). In Linux this type of copy is called 'reflink'. We will see how to use it on the XFS filesystem.",
