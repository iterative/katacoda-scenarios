Congratulations! This completes this scenario. Now you know how to create
stages and pipelines using [`dvc stage add`][dvcstageadd], and by editing
`dvc.yaml`. You also learned how to run and reproduce stages using [`dvc
repro`][dvcrepro] and visualize them using [`dvc dag`][dvcdag]. 

In the [next scenario][nextsc], we'll add more stages and parameters to
the pipeline. We'll also measure and plot the performance of our work
using DVC.
