# Track a File or Directory

Let's get a data file from the [Get
Started](https://dvc.org/doc/start/data-and-model-versioning) example project:

```
dvc get \
  https://github.com/iterative/dataset-registry \
  get-started/data.xml -o data/data.xml
```{{execute}}

> The command [`dvc get`][cmdget] is like a smart `wget` that can be used to
> retrieve artifacts from DVC repositories. You don't even need an
> _initialized_ DVC repository to use `dvc get`.

`ls -lh data/`{{execute}}

To track a large file, ML model, or a whole directory with DVC, we use `dvc add`:

`dvc add data/data.xml`{{execute}}

DVC has listed `data.xml` in `.gitignore` to make sure that we don't commit it
to Git.

`cat data/.gitignore`{{execute}}

Instead, we track `data/data.xml.dvc` with Git. 

```
git add data/.gitignore \
        data/data.xml.dvc

git commit -m "Add dataset to the project"
```{{execute}}
