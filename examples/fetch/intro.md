We will use an [example project](https://github.com/iterative/example-get-started)
with some data, code, ML models, pipeline stages, as well as a few Git
tags. Then we will see what happens with `dvc fetch` as we switch from
tag to tag.

As a prerequisite, you have to study first the
[Get Started](https://dvc.org/doc/get-started) tutorial,
otherwise it may be a bit difficult to understand the structure of the project.
