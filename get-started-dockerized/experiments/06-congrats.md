# Congratulations!

You have completed _Experiments_ scenario. We learned how to reproduce
pipelines while modifying their parameters through the command line via
[`dvc exp run`][dvcexprun]. 

We created a queue of experiments using `dvc exp run --queue` and run all
of them at once `dvc exp run --run-all`.

We reviewed the experiment results in a table with [`dvc exp
show`][dvcexpshow] and brought in the best one to the workspace [`dvc exp
apply`][dvcexpapply].

We cleaned up the remaining experiments with [`dvc exp gc`][dvcexpgc]. 

For more information about experiment management, you can [read the section in
the user guide](https://dvc.org/doc/user-guide/experiment-management). 

This completes the Getting Started course for DVC on Katacoda. Thank you
for joining us.
