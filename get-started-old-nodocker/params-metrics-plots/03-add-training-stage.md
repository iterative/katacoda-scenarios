# Add a stage for training

In this step, we'll see how parameters are defined using arguments supplied to
`dvc stage add`. 

We can check the list of current stages:

`dvc stage list`{{execute}}

We'll add a training stage that runs `train.py` and produces `model.pkl`. It
depends on the featurization stage's output. As you may have already seen in
`params.yaml` file, the stage also has 3 parameters, `seed`, `n_est` and
`min_split`. These are used to populate the global variables in `train.py`.

`src/train.py`{{open}}

We use `-p / --params` option of `dvc stage add` to associate parameters in
`params.yaml` to a stage. When you need to use a custom filename other than
`params.yaml`, you can also specify the name similar to `-p
myparamsfile.toml:myparam,another_param`. For this scenario, we stick to the
default filename.

We add a training stage and parameters using:

```
dvc stage add \
  -n train \
  -d src/train.py \
  -d data/features \
  -p train.seed,train.n_est,train.min_split \
  -o model.pkl \
  python3 src/train.py data/features model.pkl
```{{execute}}

Now let's run the whole pipeline to obtain the classification model,
`model.pkl`.

`dvc repro`{{execute}}

This runs the whole pipeline from preparation to training in a single
scoop with the parameter we supplied in `params.yaml`.

Finally, we commit the changes to Git. 

```
git add dvc.yaml dvc.lock params.yaml .gitignore
git commit -m "Added training stage"
```{{execute}}
