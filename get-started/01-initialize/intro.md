In this lesson we install DVC, and initialize a DVC project. 

Our aim is to show how to install DVC for the environment we are currently in,
and start a new project with Git and DVC.

If you prefer to run locally, you can also supply the commands in this scenario
in a container: 

```
docker run -it dvcorg/doc-katacoda:base
```{{copy}}
