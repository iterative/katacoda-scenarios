# Congratulations!

You have completed params, metrics and plots scenario. We have covered
parameters, how to update them in `dvc.yaml` files and also adding them with
`dvc stage add` commands. 

We have also presented how to add metrics and plots to stages. Getting
the updated metrics across commits and plotting them to HTML files. 

In the next scenario, we'll take a look at advanced ways to do experiments
with pipelines using frequently changing parameters.
