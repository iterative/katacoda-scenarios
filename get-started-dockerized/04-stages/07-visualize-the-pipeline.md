# Visualize the pipeline

As you learned earlier, you can list the stages with:

`dvc stage list`{{execute}}

This command lists the names and outputs of each stage.

There is another command to visualize DVC pipelines. With `dvc dag`, it's
possible to get an ASCII diagram of the stage dependencies. Let's see what
our pipeline is doing:

`DVC_PAGER=cat dvc dag`{{execute}}

Instead of the stage names, we can also get the outputs of each stage.

`DVC_PAGER=cat dvc dag --outs`{{execute}}

DVC also provides `.dot` output in GraphViz format. If you like, you can
convert this output to an image (or PS, PDF), first installing
[GraphViz][graphviz].

```
apt update -y & apt install -y graphviz
```{{execute}}

```
dvc dag --dot | dot -Tpng -o ../pipeline.png 
```{{execute}}

Now we can view the pipeline [here][pipeline].

[pipeline]: https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-80-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/pipeline.png

Let's commit the changes in this step to Git.

```
git add dvc.yaml data/.gitignore dvc.lock src/prepare.py
git commit -m "Added featurize stage"
```{{execute}}

In the next step, we'll see how to run these two stages together.
